# Did We Remember to Desegregate?: Predicting School Zones with Demographic Data
## A model to determine how predictive demographic features are of elementary school zones

Charlottesville, Virginia, like every other town in the United States, has a checkered history with race relations and public education. The city school district has sought to remedy historic wrongs by updating its school zones and eliminating maps that were drawn to keep black kids out of historically white schools. This project looks at the current map and investigates the degree to which race still informs assigned school zone. Using census data about race, economic status, education levels, age spread, and details about housing, I was able to build a model that could predict a block's assigned school district with 82.1% accuracy. My model that relied only on racial makeup predicted the correct school only 31.6% of the time, no better than a dummy model.
